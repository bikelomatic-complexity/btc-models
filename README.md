# btc-models
Shared models and validation for the Bicycle Touring Companion

BTC-Models offers a way for other parts of the application (like the server and client applications) to agree on how certain pieces of information (such as passwords, emails, schedules, etc…)  should look. When included into other parts of the application, btc-models handles logic and functions for it’s represented objects effectively separating out the data-logic code from the view code in the btc-app.
